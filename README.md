# dotfiles

Dotfiles use [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for installation.

## Prerequisites

```bash
paru install awesome-git awesome-freedesktop awesome-bling-git lain dex zoxide fzf
```

## Installation

After cloning this repo, run `install` to automatically set up the development
environment. Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run
multiple times.

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p code/hobby/dotfiles
cd code/hobby/dotfiles
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jnsbl/dotfiles.git .
./install
```

_Note: Dotfiles are symlinked to `~/.dotfiles` after installation._
